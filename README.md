Meta-programmable 3D waveform visualizer fun

I'm putting my experiments here to stash them.  This is quasi-working code.  As such:

1) OSS code is borrowed and not cited (this will be corrected shortly)
2) It doesn't 'work' unless you run it in rp5 'live' mode and create a waveform_line object and add it to $app.drawings
3) The only camera control involves using an xbox360 controller.  You must have a working controller that binds to Device0 in procontroll (for now)
